Hi, I'm [Dan](https://twitter.com/danielthepope). I studied Computer Science at the University of Bath where I learned absolutely no JavaScript whatsoever. When I was working on placement, I used jQuery to show and hide elements on a webpage, and that was it. Not exactly what you'd call sophisticated JavaScript is it?

That's all I knew when I first joined JSOxford about a year ago.

One of the first events I attended was [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io/), where I stuck some wires together and ended up with an Arduino that could [tell me the temperature](https://twitter.com/danielthepope/status/503219737527336960/photo/1). Fast-forward a few months to the Realtime hack day, where I made a webpage which sends colours to everyone connected ([Writeup here](https://danielthepope.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/realtime-hacking-with-jsoxford/)). I still feel like a beginner at every event I attend, but I really enjoy them and I'm keen to learn more!

No matter what your skill level is, you're welcome to join us at any of our events. The hack days in particular are very beginner-friendly, where the main aim is to have fun. There's always someone willing to teach the basics and get you started. Alternatively, if you know what you're doing, you can just get on with what you want to do.

We're always on the lookout for new members. If you haven't been to a hack day before, our [Summer of Hacks](http://summerofhacks.io) is the perfect place to get started. Learn, improve or perfect your JavaScript skills, and there's free food, drink and stickers. What more could you want?
