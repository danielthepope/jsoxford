So much so, that the word “browser” doesn’t really fit anymore. The web is moving beyond tabs and even beyond our screens. It's now capable of connecting us to the real world around us and transforming us into virtual reality creators.</p><p>Back in 2015, I gave a talk predicting what web development might be like in 2020. Now we're (roughly) half-way there, it's time to check in and see what I got right so far, and the big things I missed! As Tim Urban (of 'Wait But Why' fame) says, often the best way to wrap your head around something is to zoom right in and zoom right out. This talk will zoom in on the state of the web today in 2017 - including highlighting our common misconceptions about browsers. And zoom out to see where we've come from - and where we're heading...</p></div></div><hr class="heavy"></div></div><div class="row"><h2><img src="/img/icons/calendar.svg" class="icon" title="calendar icon" alt="calendar icon"> Past Events</h2><div id="PastEvents"><div class="post" data-date="2017-02-15 18:30:00 +0000"><h2 class="post-title row"><div class="col-xs-9"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/events/237549534/"><img src="/img/meetup.png" alt="Meetup"></a> <a href="/2017/The-Oxford-Mega-Super-Meetup-Meetup/">The Oxford Mega Super Meetup Meetup</a></div><div class="eventInfo col-xs-3"><span class="eventDate">Wed Feb 15</span> <span class="eventTime">06:30 PM</span> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/events/237549534/">56 went</a></div></h2><p>If you ever have trouble making decisions, then we’ve totally got you covered.  This month <a href="https://www.meetup.com/oxfordpython/">Oxford Python</a>, <a href="http://jsoxford.com/">JSOxford</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-Ruby-Users-Group-OxRUG/">OxRUG</a>, <a href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dotnetoxford">dotnetoxford</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/devopsoxford/">DevOpsOxford</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-OX/events/236818520/">WPOx</a> are going to be joining forces for a mega meetup (of super meetups).</p><p><br>We’ll be meeting at the Story Museum (just off St Aldates) at 6.30.

By the end of the day, you'll have an application that connects to a database and reads and writes information. Even better, it'll be on the internet! You can see the activities for this track <a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/">here</a>. Don't forget to come to the Friday InstallFest (see below).</p><p><b>Frontend track</b></p><p>The Frontend track is all about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We'll be building webpages, making them look *amazing*, and adding dynamic behaviour using JavaScript (click <a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/">here</a> to see the course syllabus) The only thing you need for this track is a text editor and the web browser you already use!

Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.”</em> — Mr. Miyagi, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/">The Karate Kid</a> (1984)</p></blockquote><p>Saturday 23rd of May was <a href="http://nodeschool.io/international-day/">International NodeSchool Day</a>, with workshops focused on grokking <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> taking place all over the globe.</p><p>The canny bods at <a href="http://jsoxford.com/">JSOxford</a> were running an event locally at <a href="https://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/">White October’s</a> offices in Oxford’s hip Cowley suburb as part of their <a href="http://summerofhacks.io/">Summer of Hacks</a> programme. Intrigued by the thought of spending a day immersed in NodeJS, I duly sauntered along in my <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm">Vibram’s</a> to see what was cooking in their Node kitchen. I’m glad I did because the day was proper station.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Station!”</em> — Ted, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101452/">Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey</a> (1991)</p></blockquote><h2 id="the-morning">The Morning</h2><p>The day was structured such that the first half was spent working through the <a href="https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode">learnyounode</a> workshop. This workshop is introductory Node material, covering topics such as asynchronous IO and the module system.</p><p><img src="/img/nodeschool-learnyounode-workshow.png" alt="learnyounode workshop"></p><p>This material is good and presented well via a lovely command line application. I’d recommend it to my colleagues to bootstrap their Node learning. Some of the error messages were a tad cryptic, but that’s easily addressed: one of the attendees even took the time to submit a Pull Request to improve the error message in one of the exercises.</p><p>Personally I didn’t get much from the material having already covered the content in my earlier explorations of NodeJS. It was good to structure the day this way though, because more experienced folk were thus pushed to pair with less experienced folk and there was plenty of knowledge-sharing and conversation which made me happy.</p><h2 id="the-afternoon">The Afternoon</h2><p>The second half of the day was devoted to “electives”: material that covered a specific area of NodeJS to an intermediate level. (Promises, Express, Working With Binary Data, that sort of thing.). Folk were encouraged to pick an elective that interested them, and they could then either pair with like-minded folk or strike out on their own. If folk wanted to continue with the <code>learnyounode</code> module they could do that too.</p><p>I dipped in and out of a few electives, sampling them and getting a feel for ones that I’ll work through on my own time later. The Functional Elective isn’t particularly NodeJS-focused – being more of a general ES5 elective – but Ryan and I had a fun few minutes working through the trampolining exercise.</p><p>I liked that folk could investigate areas of NodeJS that appealed to them. The (slight) downside is that folk fragmented into isolated clusters and a little of the collaborative pair programming vibe was lost.

I studied Computer Science at the University of Bath where I learned absolutely no JavaScript whatsoever. When I was working on placement, I used jQuery to show and hide elements on a webpage, and that was it. Not exactly what you’d call sophisticated JavaScript is it?</p><p>That’s all I knew when I first joined JSOxford about a year ago.</p><p>One of the first events I attended was <a href="http://nodebots.io/">NodeBots</a>, where I stuck some wires together and ended up with an Arduino that could <a href="https://twitter.com/danielthepope/status/503219737527336960/photo/1">tell me the temperature</a>. Fast-forward a few months to the Realtime hack day, where I made a webpage which sends colours to everyone connected (<a href="https://danielthepope.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/realtime-hacking-with-jsoxford/">Writeup here</a>). I still feel like a beginner at every event I attend, but I really enjoy them and I’m keen to learn more!</p><p>No matter what your skill level is, you’re welcome to join us at any of our events. The hack days in particular are very beginner-friendly, where the main aim is to have fun. There’s always someone willing to teach the basics and get you started. Alternatively, if you know what you’re doing, you can just get on with what you want to do.</p><p>We’re always on the lookout for new members. If you haven’t been to a hack day before, our <a href="http://summerofhacks.io">Summer of Hacks</a> is the perfect place to get started. Learn, improve or perfect your JavaScript skills, and there’s free food, drink and stickers. What more could you want?</p></div><hr class="heavy"><div class="post" data-date="2015-04-11 09:30:00 +0000"><h2 class="post-title row"><div class="col-xs-9"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/events/221085527/"><img src="/img/meetup.png" alt="Meetup"></a> <a href="/2015/RTHack/">RTHack</a></div><div class="eventInfo col-xs-3"><span class="eventDate">Sat Apr 11</span> <span class="eventTime">09:30 AM</span> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/events/221085527/">25 went</a></div></h2><p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/e/9/600_435340937.jpeg"></p><p>We're going to have a hack day centred around realtime web technologies.</p><p>It will be a day long event - with tonnes of opportunity to learn about, and hack with, technologies such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a>, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/">Server Sent Events</a>, <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, and more.</p><p>More details to come, but it's going to be <b>awesome</b>.
